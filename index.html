<h3>This page is to boast about the beer and food industry in Milwaukee, WI</h3>

<p>One very interesting this about Milwaukee, is that we have what is known as a traveling beer garden. 
These beer gardens are run by Sprecher Brewery, and rotate throughout the Milwaukee County Public Parks. 
</p>

<p> For your pleasure I have added below the link to the Beer Garden's schedule for the upcoming 2017 Summer season!</p>

<p>For your reference I have also added a table below outlining the dates and parks in which the Sprecher Beer Garden will be attending.</p>

<table border="2">
  <tr>
    <th>Month</th>
    <th>Park</th>
    <th>Number of Beers on Tap</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>April</td>
    <td>Kletzch</td>
    <td>Between Eight & Twelve</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>May</td>
    <td>Estabrook</td>
    <td>Less Than Six
  </tr>

<p>Below you will find a list of Non-Alchoholic Beverages you can find at the Beer Garden:</p>

<ul> 
    <li>Sprecher Root Beer on Tap!</li>
    <li>Sprecher Root Beer Float</li>

<p> As good as that beer looks, Milwaukee is also known to have some of the best brats and cheesecurds in the country!</p>
