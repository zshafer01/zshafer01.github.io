<h3>This page is to boast about the beer and food industry in Milwaukee, WI</h3>

<p>One very interesting this about Milwaukee, is that we have what is known as a traveling beer garden. 
These beer gardens are run by Sprecher Brewery, and rotate throughout the Milwaukee County Public Parks. 
</p>

<p> For your pleasure I have added below the link to the Beer Garden's schedule for the upcoming 2017 Summer season!</p>
